## Description
I am an easy going person that is usually happy eating anything or anywhere and usually try to let others pick what they want if they have a strong preference. For the times when everyone is indecisive I will just pick a completely random place. [What2Eat](https://what2eat.dkr.im) is a project I made for those times. 

You can create categories like **Fast Food**, **Mexican**, **Cheap**, **Take Out**, **Sit Down**, etc. The category could also be something like **Cook At Home** and you can add dishes that you like to cook.

Then you can add items to those categories. An item could be in more than one category like **Taco Bell** could be listed in **Fast Food**, **Cheap**, and **Mexican** (That last category is controversial).

When its time to decide you check whichever restaurants / dishes you are in the mood for and spin the wheel. What2Eat will make a random selection from the choices you have selected.
